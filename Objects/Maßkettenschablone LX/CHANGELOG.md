## Compatibility
Archicad version 24

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1] â€“ 2020-12-13
### Changed
- Instead of dedicated parameters we now use an array to store the dimension texts.
  This means also that there is no limit of dimensions anymore.

### Added
- UI (but just a `ui_listfield`) so the user can input to the array directly.
- The dimension texts can now have a back fill for better visibility in messy plans.
